# RPS_Game-JavaScript-
Rock paper and scissors game.
In the main menu there is a button to start the game.
At the beginning of the game there is a message to choose the type of object: Rock or paper or scissors and write it in the message line.
The computer randomly chooses an object by itself and that's how the winner is determined each time.
(The system default when the command line is invalid is Rock).
